// Package twipi contains basic abstractions around some Twilio APIs. It's
// designed to easily allow Twilio to be used in a Go application by providing
// high-level abstractions around the API.
//
// If you're making a Twilio application that can handle replying to commands,
// also consider using the twicli package.
